This study aims to classify lung conditions (Normal, COVID-19, Pneumonia) using X-ray images through the application of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. Data preprocessing was performed using ImageDataGenerator, including augmentation techniques such as rotation, translation, and horizontal flipping to enhance model performance. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing data with proportions of 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. The designed CNN model consists of several convolutional layers with ReLU activation and pooling layers, followed by dense layers with softmax activation for three-class classification. The model training process utilized the Adam optimizer and accuracy metrics. Early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting. Experimental results showed that the model achieved high accuracy performance on validation and testing data. The evaluation metrics included classification reports, confusion matrices, as well as accuracy and loss curves during training. With this approach, the study is expected to contribute to the development of AI-based technology to support faster and more accurate clinical diagnoses.
